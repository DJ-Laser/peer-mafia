# Peer to Peer Mafia Tracker

A free online tool to track players and roles dor your Mafia/Werewolf games.

To get started simply click the host link at the top, where you will be given a room code and sharable link for players.

This site is completely free, and works entirely peer to peer (no game servers) using WebRTC.

I am using a free limited TURN server (Data relay when both peers are behind NAT) that has 500gb a month, but since there is no video or audios being transmitted it would take an unreasonable amount of traffic to pass that limit.
